    <p>Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

The h2 element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.
      
p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".</p>
    <p>HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags make your HTML easier to read, and also help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.
      
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

Note that img elements are self-closing.

All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

You can use anchor elements to link to content outside of your web page.

anchor elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text.
      
Anchor elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

      Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.</p>
    <p>You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

Nest your image within an a element. Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.
      
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.

Unordered lists start with an opening ul element, followed by any number of li elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a ul. HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

Ordered lists start with an opening ol element, followed by any number of li elements. Finally, ordered lists close with an ol. Input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.

Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.

You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element.</p>
    <p>You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

Radio buttons are a type of input.

Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input

Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element.The challenges so far have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. However, there are a few elements that give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document.

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.</p>

    <header>Basic CSS</header>
    <p>Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the color style property.

You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

CSS borders have properties like style, color and width

      You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.</p>
    
    <p>You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.

Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border.

An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.

Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more padding than the blue box.

When you increase the blue box's padding, it will increase the distance(padding) between the text and the border around it.

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has a bigger margin than the blue box, making it appear smaller.

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

      If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.</p>
    <p>The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with pixels (px). Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to px, CSS has a number of different length unit options that you can use.

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.
      
      Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.

Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.

Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.

We just proved that our classes will override the body element's CSS. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first.We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom. That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.

But we're not done yet. There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember id attributes?
      
      So we've proven that id declarations override class declarations, regardless of where they are declared in your style element CSS.

There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember inline styles?

Yay! We just proved that inline styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.

But wait. There's one last way to override CSS. This is the most powerful method of all. But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.

In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Applied_Visual_Design">
    <header>Applied Visual Design</header>
    <p>This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.
      You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. 
      You can specify the height of an element using the height property in CSS, similar to the width property. 
    </p>
    <p>You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content. In HTML, hr is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag. The font size of header tags (h1 through h6) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the font-size property to adjust the size of the text in an element.The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element), offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element), blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value, in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.
The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.</p>
    <p>A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element. The styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.
      The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.

When elements are positioned to overlap, the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block.</p>
    <p>One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.
      To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function.The transform property has a variety of functions that lets you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.</p>
    <p>By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
      One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to add something before or after a selected element. In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class heart:
<code>
.heart::before {
  content: "";
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 25%;
  position: absolute;
  height: 50px;
  width: 70px;
  top: -50px;
  left: 5px;
}<br>
      </code>
For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string.

In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.
      To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:
      <code>
        #anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
      </code>
      For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.
      You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.
      That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished.</p>
    <p>When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.

As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the 50% keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.
      <code>
        @keyframes rainbow {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
    top: 0px;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: green;
    top: 50px;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
    top: 0px;
  }
}
      </code>
      For this challenge, you'll change the opacity of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.
      The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

animation-iteration-count: 3;

In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.

In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.

In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.

The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 "anchor" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:

animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);

In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:
<code>
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);
      </code>
Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.

The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:
<code>
cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);
      </code>
Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on an 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.

  <section class="main-section" id="Applied_Accessibility">
    <header>Applied Accessibility</header>
    <p>It's likely you've seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative. This helps in case the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text is short but descriptive, and meant to briefly convey the meaning of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.
      Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.

If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content.

Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.

As an example, a page with an h2 element followed by several subsections labeled with h4 tags would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.

One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main subject of your content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.

By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.
      
      article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. Article is a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgement call, but there are a couple simple tests you can use. Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?

Remember that folks using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand your work.

Note about section and div
The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>div - groups content</li>
        <li>section - groups related content</li>
        <li>article - groups independent, self-contained content</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  <p>The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.

Note
header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.
    The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a nav tag as well. Using a footer (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.
    Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.

For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users. Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.

The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.

You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a label element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the for attribute as explained in this lesson.</p>
  <p>The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.

The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.

The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.
    Forms often include the input field, which can be used to create several different form controls. The type attribute on this element indicates what kind of input will be created.

You may have noticed the text and submit input types in prior challenges, and HTML5 introduced an option to specify a date field. Depending on browser support, a date picker shows up in the input field when it's in focus, which makes filling in a form easier for all users.

For older browsers, the type will default to text, so it helps to show users the expected date format in the label or as placeholder text just in case.
    Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.
    Have you noticed that all of the applied accessibility challenges so far haven't used any CSS? This is to show the importance of a logical document outline, and using semantically meaningful tags around your content before introducing the visual design aspect.

However, CSS's magic can also improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.
    Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast improves the readability of your content, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.
    Color is a large part of visual design, but its use introduces two accessibility issues. First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.

Previous challenges covered having text alternatives to address the first issue. The last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.

Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others - usually in hue but sometimes lightness as well. You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors.

In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be reached by darkening the darker color and lightening the lighter one with the aid of a color contrast checker. Darker colors on the color wheel are considered to be blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.
    There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength of light to the inability to see color at all. The most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.

For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of your content, a colorblind user may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought of as neighbors on the color wheel, and those combinations should be avoided when conveying important information.

Note
Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of colorblindness. These are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.
    Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.

Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (a) tags. Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful. Instead, you should use brief but descriptive text within the a tags to provide more meaning for these users.
    HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.

HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.
    The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior.

Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them.
    Note
A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when a div used for a pop-up window is activated), and is beyond the scope of these challenges.
    The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.

Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.

It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This technique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Responsive_Web_Design_Principle">
    <header>Responsive Web Design Principle</header>
    <p>Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.

Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. You can have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.
      The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container, but the image won't stretch wider than its original width. Setting the display property to block changes the image from an inline element (its default), to a block element on its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.
      The simplest way to make your images appear "retina" (and optimize them for retina displays) is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.
      Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items. Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

The four different viewport units are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.</li>
  <li>vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.</li>
  <li>vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).</li>
  <li>vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Flexbox">
    <header>CSS Flexbox</header>
    <p>This section uses alternating challenge styles to show how to use CSS to position elements in a flexible way. First, a challenge will explain theory, then a practical challenge using a simple tweet component will apply the flexbox concept.

Placing the CSS property display: flex; on an element allows you to use other flex properties to build a responsive page.
      Adding display: flex to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the flex-direction property to the parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children vertically.

Other options for flex-direction are row-reverse and column-reverse.

Note
The default value for the flex-direction property is row.
      The header and footer in the tweet embed example have child items that could be arranged as rows using the flex-direction property. This tells CSS to align the children horizontally.
      The last two challenges used the flex-direction property set to row. This property can also create a column by vertically stacking the children of a flex container.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the flex items within a flex container do not fill all the space in the container. It is common to want to tell CSS how to align and space out the flex items a certain way. Fortunately, the justify-content property has several options to do this. 
Recall that setting a flex container as a row places the flex items side-by-side from left-to-right. A flex container set as a column places the flex items in a vertical stack from top-to-bottom. For each, the direction the flex items are arranged is called the main axis. For a row, this is a horizontal line that cuts through each item. And for a column, the main axis is a vertical line through the items.

There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of the most commonly used is justify-content: center;, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside the flex container. Others options include:
<ul>
<li>flex-start: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container.</li>
<li>flex-end: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.</li>
<li>space-between: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the other items between them are spaced evenly.</li>
<li>space-around: similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items</li>
The align-items property is similar to justify-content. Recall that the justify-content property aligned flex items along the main axis. For rows, the main axis is a horizontal line and for columns it is a vertical line.

Flex containers also have a cross axis which is the opposite of the main axis. For rows, the cross axis is vertical and for columns, the cross axis is horizontal.

CSS offers the align-items property to align flex items along the cross axis. For a row, it tells CSS how to push the items in the entire row up or down within the container. And for a column, how to push all the items left or right within the container.

The different values available for align-items include:
<ul>
<li>flex-start: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the top of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the left of the container.</li>
<li>flex-end: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For rows, this aligns items to the bottom of the container. For columns, this aligns items to the right of the container.</li>
<li>center: align items to the center. For rows, this vertically aligns items (equal space above and below the items). For columns, this horizontally aligns them (equal space to the left and right of the items).</li>
<li>stretch: stretch the items to fill the flex container. For example, rows items are stretched to fill the flex container top-to-bottom.</li>
<li>baseline: align items to their baselines. Baseline is a text concept, think of it as the line that the letters sit on.</li>
  </ul>
  CSS flexbox has a feature to split a flex item into multiple rows (or columns). By default, a flex container will fit all flex items together. For example, a row will all be on one line.

However, using the flex-wrap property, it tells CSS to wrap items. This means extra items move into a new row or column. The break point of where the wrapping happens depends on the size of the items and the size of the container.

CSS also has options for the direction of the wrap:
<ul>
  <li>nowrap: this is the default setting, and does not wrap items.</li>
<li>wrap: wraps items from left-to-right if they are in a row, or top-to-bottom if they are in a column.</li>
<li>wrap-reverse: wraps items from bottom-to-top if they are in a row, or right-to-left if they are in a column.</li>
  </ul>
   So far, all the properties in the challenges apply to the flex container (the parent of the flex items). However, there are several useful properties for the flex items.

The first is the flex-shrink property. When it's used, it allows an item to shrink if the flex container is too small. Items shrink when the width of the parent container is smaller than the combined widths of all the flex items within it.

The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values. The higher the number, the more it will shrink compared to the other items in the container. For example, if one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will shrink three times as much as the other.
  The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. Recall that flex-shrink controls the size of the items when the container shrinks. The flex-grow property controls the size of items when the parent container expands.

Using a similar example from the last challenge, if one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.The flex-basis property specifies the initial size of the item before CSS makes adjustments with flex-shrink or flex-grow.

The units used by the flex-basis property are the same as other size properties (px, em, %, etc.). The value auto sizes items based on the content.
  There is a shortcut available to set several flex properties at once. The flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties can all be set together by using the flex property.

For example, flex: 1 0 10px; will set the item to flex-grow: 1;, flex-shrink: 0;, and flex-basis: 10px;.

The default property settings are flex: 0 1 auto;.

The order property is used to tell CSS the order of how flex items appear in the flex container. By default, items will appear in the same order they come in the source HTML. The property takes numbers as values, and negative numbers can be used.
  The final property for flex items is align-self. This property allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually, instead of setting them all at once. This is useful since other common adjustment techniques using the CSS properties float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex items.

align-self accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the align-items property.

  <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Grid">
    <header>CSS Grid</header>
    <p>Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its display property to grid. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.

Note
In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.
      Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the grid, use the grid-template-columns property on a grid container as demonstrated below:
<code>
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
}
      </code>
This will give your grid two columns that are 50px wide each.

The number of parameters given to the grid-template-columns property indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.
      You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns. You can use these as well:<br>
<ul>
  <li>fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,</li>

  <li>auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,</li>

  <li>%: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.</li>
    </ul>
Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:
<code>
  grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;</code>
This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content, the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container, and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.
So far in the grids you have created, the columns have all been tight up against each other. Sometimes you want a gap in between the columns. To add a gap between the columns, use the grid-column-gap property like this:
<code>
  grid-column-gap: 10px;</code>
This creates 10px of empty space between all of our columns.
grid-gap is a shorthand property for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap from the previous two challenges that's more convenient to use. If grid-gap has one value, it will create a gap between all rows and columns. However, if there are two values, it will use the first one to set the gap between the rows and the second value for the columns.
Up to this point, all the properties that have been discussed are for grid containers. The grid-column property is the first one for use on the grid items themselves.

The hypothetical horizontal and vertical lines that create the grid are referred to as lines. These lines are numbered starting with 1 at the top left corner of the grid and move right for columns and down for rows, counting upward.
    To control the amount of columns an item will consume, you can use the grid-column property in conjunction with the line numbers you want the item to start and stop at.

Here's an example:
<code>
  grid-column: 1 / 3;</code>
This will make the item start at the first vertical line of the grid on the left and span to the 3rd line of the grid, consuming two columns.
    </p>
<p>In CSS Grid, the content of each item is located in a box which is referred to as a cell. You can align the content's position within its cell horizontally using the justify-self property on a grid item. By default, this property has a value of stretch, which will make the content fill the whole width of the cell. This CSS Grid property accepts other values as well:
<ul>
  <li>start: aligns the content at the left of the cell,</li>

  <li>center: aligns the content in the center of the cell,</li>

  <li>end: aligns the content at the right of the cell.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes you want all the items in your CSS Grid to share the same alignment. You can use the previously learned properties and align them individually, or you can align them all at once horizontally by using justify-items on your grid container. This property can accept all the same values you learned about in the previous two challenges, the difference being that it will move all the items in our grid to the desired alignment.
You can group cells of your grid together into an area and give the area a custom name. Do this by using grid-template-areas on the container like this:
<code>
grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";</code>
The code above merges the top three cells together into an area named header, the bottom three cells into a footer area, and it makes two areas in the middle row; advert and content.

Note
Every word in the code represents a cell and every pair of quotation marks represent a row.

In addition to custom labels, you can use a period (.) to designate an empty cell in the grid.
After creating an areas template for your grid container, as shown in the previous challenge, you can place an item in your custom area by referencing the name you gave it. To do this, you use the grid-area property on an item like this:
<code>
  .item1 { grid-area: header; }</code>
This lets the grid know that you want the item1 class to go in the area named header. In this case, the item will use the entire top row because that whole row is named as the header area.
The grid-area property you learned in the last challenge can be used in another way. If your grid doesn't have an areas template to reference, you can create an area on the fly for an item to be placed like this:
<code>
  item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4; }</code>
This is using the line numbers you learned about earlier to define where the area for this item will be. The numbers in the example above represent these values:
<code>
grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;</code>
So the item in the example will consume the rows between lines 1 and 2, and the columns between lines 1 and 4.
When you used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the structure of a grid, you entered a value for each row or column you created.

Lets say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. It isn't very practical to insert 100 values individually. Fortunately, there's a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you want your column or row to be repeated, followed by a comma and the value you want to repeat.

Here's an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.
<code>
  grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);</code>
You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function, and insert the function amongst other values when defining a grid structure. Here's what I mean:
<code>
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;</code>
This translates to:
<code>
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;</code>
Note
1fr 50px is repeated twice followed by 20px.
There's another built-in function to use with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows called minmax. It's used to limit the size of items when the grid container changes size. To do this you need to specify the acceptable size range for your item. Here is an example:
<code>
  grid-template-columns: 100px minmax(50px, 200px);</code>
In the code above, grid-template-columns is set to create two columns; the first is 100px wide, and the second has the minimum width of 50px and the maximum width of 200px.
The repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill. This allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possible depending on the size of the container. You can create flexible layouts when combining auto-fill with minmax.

In the preview, grid-template-columns is set to
<code>
  repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));</code>
When the container changes size, this setup keeps inserting 60px columns and stretching them until it can insert another one.

Note
If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.
auto-fit works almost identically to auto-fill. The only difference is that when the container's size exceeds the size of all the items combined, auto-fill keeps inserting empty rows or columns and pushes your items to the side, while auto-fit collapses those empty rows or columns and stretches your items to fit the size of the container.

Note
If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.
